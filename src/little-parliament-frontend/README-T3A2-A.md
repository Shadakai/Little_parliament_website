# Desciption of Website

## Client

'Little Parliament' and 'Our Store' is a quaint little cafe in Rainbow Beach that doubles up as a souvenir gift shop.

## Purpose and Functionality

Brief - Create a website for a cafe and souvenir store called Little Parliament. This website should act as a landing page for customers who don't know that Little Parliament exists yet. It will showcase the menu, a little bit about the cafe as well as the products that are for sale in the store. As Little Parliament is located in Rainbow Beach, a secluded tourist town, guests to the town like to have an idea of what is available before arriving at the town. This means the content on the website should be clear, concise, and not overwhelming.

The landing page should give a good quick synopsis about the cafe, as well as be alluring enough to make the user explore more of the page. The next page would be an about us page and would showcase more detail about why the cafe exists as well as a little information about the owners. The menu page would showcase the menu in a fun way; instead of just being a static image, it will be an interactive page that has a small description, image, and price of all the items on the menu. The products page would be a static image page that has a list of all current items in stock, with the ability to add these items to a cart, purchase them, and possibly reserve them for pick-up.

As this will be a website with the possibility of becoming live, the owner of the cafe would like to be able to make changes without having to go through a developer. An admin panel where they can log in and add, update and delete products and menu items as the need arises.

### Features

#### Menu showcase

This website will have an entire page dedicated to the Menu of Little Parliament. The menu will showcase each individual item that is on the menu, as well as a brief description of it, the price of the item, and an image that shows off the final product. The menu will be a free-flowing list with a little bit of animation to draw the attention of the user of the website to the products. The menu will also allow you to click onto each product and open a more detailed version of it. There will be the ability to filter the category of food items (coffee, Breakfast, Lunch), giving the user an easy way to browse the menu.

#### Products Page/Cart

As Little Parliament also has a souvenir/gift shop attached to it called 'Our Shop', we are implementing a products page that showcases all the items that are available in-store. The products will be purchasable from this page and will display a price, an image, and a small description. The product can also be clicked on to open a more detailed page that may showcase multiple images, a detailed description, and the ability to add it to a cart.

The cart system will showcase everything you've added to the cart so far, a total of how much your order has accumulated. As well as give you the option to edit existing products, delete them or check out.

The checkout system will be integrated with Stripe and allow the user to purchase items that have been first added to the cart. As this is a small beach town, the client doesn't wish to use post, so all users will be notified that their product is ready for pick-up via a mailing system.

#### Mailing system

This project will implement a mailer system that will automatically email users after certain actions are completed. The most important action that is performed is sending users receipts as well as confirmation when products are purchased. This should be automatic and customizable so that each user gets a unique experience with the email. Users are also able to subscribe to an ongoing email newsletter that gives them updates on Little Parliament and Our Shop.

#### Admin panel

As the Client wants to make this website live and isn't tech-savvy enough to understand how to implement code, she wants to be able to make changes and update the website. This is why an admin panel will be added, a secret area that lets her input sign-in details, which then takes her to an area that lets her perform certain actions on the website with ease. Actions such as:

- Products - Add / Remove / Edit Products - Adjust option to make certain products "Featured" - Maybe the ability to put items on sale (prob just for products)? - Stock tracking
- Menu - Ability to add/remove/edit products from the menu (different table to the products she sells) - Same deal about featured - Set item to sold out
- Newsletter [ Enabled / Disabled ] - Mailing list table - Some sort of an option to unsubscribe from the mailing list

These actions will be shown on an easy-to-understand UI dashboard that lets her make the changes live to the site.

#### Stay-up-to-date

There will be a stay up-to-date section on this website that will portray recent news to the viewers of this website. First and foremost this will be seen with an Instagram integration which will display the 5-6 most recent posts made by Little Parliament. There will also be links on this section that will take the user to the respective social media accounts. This will also be where users can subscribe to the ongoing email newsletter.

### Additional nice-to-have features

#### Table ordering

A feature that would be nice to have is the ability to get to the menu page from an external QR code. Once there, it would be great if the user could order food from the menu, pay for it through the website and then have the food delivered to the kitchen through the pre-existing till system.

This would simplify the process of taking orders and handling payments but would be entirely dependent on the pre-existing systems within Little Parliament.

#### Reserving Items

Another nice to have feature for the Our Shop section of this website is the ability to put an item on hold. You've browsed the products and really want to pick something up but know you won't be able to get into the shop for another few days. This feature will allow users to have peace of mind that the product they have their eye on won't be sold out by the next time they swing by.

## Target audience

The target audiences for the caf√© website will include:

- Current customers
- Tourists
- Cafe owner/staff
- Any other locals in the area who may become repeat customers
- Anyone looking for souvenirs or other nice products to take home from the cafes beautiful location of Rainbow Beach
- People with specific dietary requirements as Little Parliament offers a range of dairy-free milk options, locally sourced ingredients and vegan food options.

As such, the design and styling of the website will take this into account, offering a website that is appropriately themed to take this into account, and provides all of the features such an audience would come to expect such as -

## Part 2 Planning

### Strength and Weaknesses Breakdown

Sam is in charge of handling the backend as he has more experience with Rails. He also doesnt have a huge interest in frontend design.
Axel and Tia are colloborating on the frontend, since there is more work to do there and we want to prioritise creating a very high quality product for the user. The frontend work was also split so that each of us would get a few easy ones and a few hard ones to do.

### Notes

- Breakdown of tasks in https://trello.com/b/1glz1Gcf/t3a2-fullstack, used for larger scope issues. Make sure we are tagging each other as necessary and linking to commits with relevant changes so that we can traceback issues if necessary.
- More detailed tickets are handled on Jira, https://littleparliament.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/LIT/board

# Libraries 

## TailwindCSS/MaterialUI

As we started the process of planning not a lot of libraries were gonna be used, mainly just tailwindcss to handle some of the styling, as tailwind is easy to use and comes out with great designs. However as tailwind was chosen as it would make designing and styling the website a lot easier, it would make sense that if something even easier to use came along it would be used. We did some experimenting and found material UI and used it in a few of the pages to see what it could do. Material UI takes the component aspect of React to a whole new level allowing you to import custom built components and use them with ease. It also allows you to add styling in a similar way as tailwind does, by simply adding the class it will take care of the rest. 

This meant when creating pages we didnt have to write out cluky HTML to build out a component then, refactor and turn that clunky HTML into a component on its own. This allowed us to make our code a lot dryer and a lot more user friendly. 

## Axios 

Axios is a library that allows API functionality to run a lot more smoothly. Handling all the backend interactions the exact same way as a fetch would, except axios works based off promises. You are able to make this functionality async meaning you can have your users use the page without having to wait for a fetch call or api call that would normally hult whats going. This allows you to show them dummy data/default placeholders into the package arrives safely and renders on screen. 

## Fontawesome 

Fontawesome is an awesome library that I use in almost all of my applications. It gives the developer access to a ton of material icons that can be easily used anywhere. This saves you heaps of time as you dont have to get a designer to make all these well known icons that users have come to love. Need a delete icon? no problem fontawesome has you covered, a profile icon? , a cart icon? , a rubber duck? no problem. The icons also count as font so you dont waste precious memory storing all these icons as well, which has the benefit of increasing performance. 

# User Testing 

## Dev testing round 1 

As the website wasnt currently on netlify at this point most of the user testing had to be done by annyoing Axels roommates and getting feedback. Heres what they had to say for dev testing round 1, which at this point was only the index page. 

### Sam Lester

"I really like the color scheme. The images seem to squished together, maybe if you made them alternate left right it could look better"

### Tanya Armstrong 

"I love it! It has a beachie theme, which makes it seem like a calm chill cafe to visit."

### Sean Robinson

"I dont like how the first image takes up the whole screen, the text is also hard to read on it."

#### Steps taken after first round 
- Created an alternating layout for the components
- Lightened up the images to make text more readable on them

## Dev testing round 2

The website had been deployed on netlify and menu page had just been released. 

### Sam Lester

"Looks good! The menu seems a bit boring, also theres a lot to scroll through which kinda sucks"

### Tanya Armstrong

"Amazing job!"

### Sean Robinson

"Hey Axel, Just finished testing the website, everything looks good  I've just noticed that the navbar goes off the screen when I use it on my phone. I think this happens for most of the home page."

### Logan John

"Looks good mate, the photos on the menu dont look that appetizing though"

### Brianna Wait 

"I love it!"

### Carly Ladas(Client)

"Hello Axel! 
Just tested the website. Noticed the index page is a bit wonky on the mobile. And I'm not a huge fan of the green your using, I'll send through hex values for the one we use. But besides that everything looks great "

#### Steps taken after second round
- Use Little Parliamanets brand colours 
- Created ticket to fix index page rendering wrong on mobile 
- Created ticket to fix navbar rendering wrong on mobile
- Reminder not to do user testing with place holder images
- added buttons at top of menu to jump the page

## Dev testing round 3

Menu item detail page added, products added, footer added

### Sam Lester

"Looks a lot better then last time, im glad i dont have to scroll through the entire menu page"
"menu details look plain"

### Sean Robinson

"Everything looks good. Are you guys having people be able to purchase the products?"

### Logan John

"I dont like how the menu items group together, they seem kinda random and not apart of the same group"

#### Steps taken after second round
- none 

## Production testing round 1

### Sam Lester

"The words look a little squished on the product screen"

### Tanya Armstrong

"Theres a lot of white space in the mobile version of mobile. Is this done on purpose?"

### Sean Robinson

"Hey Axel, Just finished testing the website. The buttons on the index page dont work??"

### Logan John

"Looks good"

### Carly Ladas(Client)

"Hello Axel, Thanks for doing this for me. I've had play with it and theres a few things that I would love if they got fixed. The buttons on the home screen dont actually do anything...
